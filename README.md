## Description

Welcome to the `SnakeRiverFishStatus` GitHub repository! The repo
contains data, scripts, functions, and workflow to estimate adult
Chinook salmon and steelhead escapement to Lower Granite Dam (LGR) as
well as to instream PIT-tag detection systems (IPTDS) throughout the
Snake River basin. Adult abundances are also provided for Snake River
Interior Columbia Technical Recovery Team (ICTRT) populations, where
available, and are the summation of one or more IPTDS sites within the
population.

Estimates of total adult escapement at LGR use the **ST**ate space
**A**dult **D**am **E**scapement **M**odel (STADEM) which is described
in [See et
al.Â (2021)](https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nafm.10649).
The STADEM R package is maintained
[here](https://github.com/KevinSee/STADEM).
