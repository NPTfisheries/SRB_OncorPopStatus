ANR is solar powered which charges two 12 volt batteries via a Renogy Rover contained within a Jobox, which in turn powers a 12 volt IS1001 reader board connected to a Bluetooth data logger housed within a PVC pod next to the antenna. ANR is a seasonally operated site intended to monitor anadromous fish utilization of the old ranch property as habitat improvements are implemented, specifically adult steelhead spawning distribution.","c(-119.369198, 48.746841)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
